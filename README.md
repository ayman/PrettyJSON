# PrettyJSON

So Safari 12 changed its extensions format. I had a plugin that worked to pretty print JSON but now it won't work.

While there were a few JSON Pretty Print extensions free in the store already, I decided to make another...couldn't hurt right?  Plus I can add stuff I want.

Also, community contributions are welcome. File an issue to discuss and send a pull request. 

Right now three things are needed:
1. Folding blocks
2. Context menu to toggle raw (the toolbar button does this but it should be in the context menu as well).
3. The disable icon code seems not to work.

## Building

You need a host application to build and test the plugin, this is the cocoa app called `Safari Extensions`. 

Follow along with the [Apple instructions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/safari_app_extensions/building_a_safari_app_extension).
