## About
So Safari 12 changed its extensions format. I had a plugin that worked to pretty print JSON but now it won't work.

While there were a few JSON Pretty Print extensions in the store already, I decided to make another...couldn't hurt right?  Plus I can add stuff I want. Plus it's free and open source.

Also, community contributions are welcome. File an issue to discuss and send a pull request. 

Right now a few things are needed (see the issues).
