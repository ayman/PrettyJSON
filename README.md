# PrettyJSON

## App Store
[PrettyJSON for Safari](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1445328303) now in the Apple App Store!

## About
So Safari 12 changed its extensions format. I had a plugin that worked to pretty print JSON but now it won't work.

While there were a few JSON Pretty Print extensions free in the store already, I decided to make another...couldn't hurt right?  Plus I can add stuff I want.

Also, community contributions are welcome. File an issue to discuss and send a pull request. 

Right now three things are needed:
1. Folding blocks
2. Context menu to toggle raw (the toolbar button does this but it should be in the context menu as well).

Follow the Issues for more.

## Building

You need a host application to build and test the plugin, this is the cocoa app called `PrettyJSON`.

The actual extension is called `SafariExtension`.

Follow along with the [Apple instructions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/safari_app_extensions/building_a_safari_app_extension) to get a sense of how this all works.
